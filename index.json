At the same time, the feverish expressivity is based on a cleverly calculated use of a tremendously large orchestra. In addition, Andris Nelsons and the Berliner Philharmoniker are presenting Debussy’s dreamy Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune and Edgard Varèse’s orchestral work Arcana, which conjures up cosmic forces, on this French programme. longtext short text, written exclusively for the Digital Concert Hall - this is displayed on all DCH interfaces and is typically available in all supported languages   description “Only when I heard Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune for the first time did I realize what music really is.” None other than Maurice Ravel said that about Claude Debussy’s epoch-making masterpiece, based on the poem of the same name by Stéphane Mallarmé. His artful play with timbres rang in modernism in music: “Music began to draw new breath with the flute of the faun” (Pierre Boulez). The audience at the premiere was enthusiastic about the piece: “There was a vast silence in the hall as I ascended to the podium and our splendid flutist, Barrère, unfolded his opening line,” the evening’s conductor, Gustave Doret, recalled. “All at once I felt behind me […] an audience that was totally spellbound. It was a complete triumph.” The music, whose iridescent sound images evoke the world of ancient Arcadia conveyed by the poetry, was so wildly applauded that it had to be repeated.\nAt his guest appearance this year, Andris Nelsons, who has regularly conducted the Berliner Philharmoniker since his debut in October 2010, has placed Debussy’s Prélude at the beginning of a French evening. The shooting star on the classical music scene – appointed the new Kapellmeister at Leipzig’s Gewandhaus (thus following in the footsteps of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter) only one year after his leap to heading up the Boston Symphony Orchestra – will then address Edgard Varèse’s magnum opus Arcana, a visionary homage to the doctor, philosopher and alchemist Paracelsus: “arcana” are those substances which aid in opening up worlds that are actually beyond human access. The main symphonic work on the two evenings is Hector Berlioz’s burlesque Symphonie fantastique, which as a “fantastic tale” plays in the imaginary world of an imaginary musician “of pathological sensitivity” who, “convinced that his love is unappreciated,” poisons himself with opium (Berlioz). The work ends with Songe d’une Nuit du Sabbat, a “bizarre night piece” (Heinrich Heine) which could not be explained using the form criteria developed until then. We can particularly look forward to Nelsons’ impulsive interpretation: his infectious enthusiasm for music when conducting seems to know no yesterday and no tomorrow! “Compared to the Witches’ Sabbath,” wrote the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in 1843, “[…] Weber’s Wolf’s Glen is a lullaby.” longtext long form description, originally written for the programme brochure for the event in the Berliner Philharmonie, typically only available in DE / EN   sponsors not used longtext    photo_credit Photo: Wilfried Hösl varchar(255) name of photographer or agency / copyright   trailer_url_sd only used until end of 2017 varchar(255) low resolution trailer   trailer_url_hd only used until end of 2017 varchar(255) high resolution trailer    Concert Relations Please check the following database tables for detailed information about data releated to concerts :\n dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert_artist dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert_category dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert_piece dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert_season dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert_season_label dchcore -\u0026gt; cms_concert_translation  Programme, booklet and biographies Each concert programme is accompanied by a programme booklet and a biography of the performing artist(s).

	"content": " Access tokens OAuth secured calls require a set authorization header with an API 2.0 access token. These calls are marked with in the documentation.\nAn access token can be one for an anonymous user or one for a logged in user. These tokens come in the form of a JWT (see https://jwt.io/).\nThe concept of expiring access tokens and retrieving new access tokens with a refresh token is not fully implemented yet and won\u0026rsquo;t be available for some time after the initial launch of API 2.0. Therefore, access tokens have a life time of 3 years at the moment and clients will not have to store refresh tokens or try to retrieve a new access token if the current access token is invalid. However, access tokens can also become invalid when the user deletes the connection of a specific device to his account remotely via our website. So clients MUST treat this scenario as if the user has disconnected his device.\nVerifying the access token All access tokens are signed by the API using a 1024-Bit RSA key. Thus, if a client chooses to do so, it can verify the token using the APIs public key (see https://jwt.io/introduction/#signature for details).

	"content": " The current setup processes and stores Apache HTTP logs from all LIVE, TEST, and DEV systems. It is running on a single AWS machine (\u0026ldquo;DCH ELK (WIP)\u0026ldquo;).\nThe logs are being fed by Filebeat, which is installed individually on all servers where log files are located (i.e. the LIVE, TEST and DEV servers). Filebeat is a light-weight data shipper similar to Logstash, but with limited capabilities. It is designed specifically to read local log files line by line, while putting very little strain on the machine\u0026rsquo;s hardware resources.\nThe local Filebeat instances are sending the logs to Logstash for further processing (mainly extracting the individual data fields out of a single log line), which afterwards sends them to Elasticsearch for storage.\nElasticsearch Indices All log lines are stored in weekly indices. The Apache log lines are assigned to index names that follow this pattern:\napache_\u0026lt;log type\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;host type\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;year\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;week\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;log type\u0026gt; is replaced by \u0026ldquo;access\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo;, depending on the type of log file.\n\u0026lt;host type\u0026gt; is replaced by the type of server the log line originated from: \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; for LIVE #1-4, \u0026ldquo;adminvm\u0026rdquo; for the LIVE Admin VM, \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; for TEST #1-2, \u0026ldquo;dev\u0026rdquo; for DEV #1-9 and \u0026ldquo;devtv\u0026rdquo; for DEV-TV.\n\u0026lt;year\u0026gt; is replaced by the year the line was written in, compliant with the week date specification of ISO 8601.\n\u0026lt;week\u0026gt; is replaced by the week number (of the year) the line was written in, compliant with the week date specification of ISO 8601.\nIndex Patterns An index pattern represents all Elasticsearch indices matching the indicated pattern and determines which logs are visible and ready to be analyzed/searched through. For example, if you wanted to look at the access logs of all LIVE servers, you would choose the apache_access_live-* pattern. The * character is a wildcard, i.e. in this case, all indices are included that start with apache_access_live- are included (the only thing that follows is the date, see \u0026ldquo;Elasticsearch Indices\u0026rdquo; section above).\nIf you wanted to look at the error logs of all DEV servers, you would choose the apache_error_dev-* pattern.\n"

	"content": " Typography on the DCH Platform aims to replicate the feel of the Berliner Philharmoniker brand in a visual way, while feeling at home on each digital platform seperately. With a quite neutral family as the baseline, default platform typefaces are used with certain spacing techniques to create the same look and feel across all devices, yet each version feels at home on the OS in question. The feel of type is much more defined by the space around it, the line-height and its role in the vertical rhythm of the design, the tracking between the letters, and the weight of the type. By focusing on limited but powerful text styles across the whole platform, we can then offer OS-specific variations on type treatment for those styles.\nTypeface The brand typeface for Berliner Philharmoniker is Akzidenz Grotesk. To convey the same feeling on digital platforms, it is important to use a sans-serif Grotesque with certain guidelines for each alternative. It is also a plus if the typeface selected feels at home on the respective platform. Here’s a list of the alternatives:\n   Platform Typeface     iOS San Francisco   Android Roboto   Web Helvetica, Arial   Windows Segoe UI   Roku Roku System Font    Type Scale The DCH Design System uses a 8pt grid with a 4pt baseline grid. Certain type sizes have been carefully selected to compliment that grid.\n   Type Size Line-Height Size Ratio     10 16 0.625   12 16 0.75   14 20 0.875   16 24 1   18 24 1.125   28 36 1.75   32 40 2    Paragraph spacing = 1 x line-height\nType Styles If a new feature or unit is impossible to design without adding a new style, it needs to go through a design review and then be added into the Design System before being implemented anywhere. New styles should have potential use cases beyond just the newest element designed.\nType Styles are separated into three groups:\n Headers - Styles that define either a page or a part of it Body - Anything that exists within the flow of the page content Elements - Unique visual elements like buttons, labels, where space is limited  \nIf a new feature or unit is impossible to design without adding a new style, it needs to go through a design review and then be added into the Design System before being implemented anywhere. New styles should have potential use cases beyond just the newest element designed.\nType Colors Colors are separated from style for greater flexibility. Most type is defined by contrast. High is the default value and does not need to be specified.\nFor more information: * Color and Contrast\n Text Variables XS - S \nM \n   "

	"content": " For a standard DCH broadcast from the Philharmonie wie use the following workflow:\nSetup and Workflow 1) Encoding in the Philharmonie The input live signal is encoded with two Digital Rapid encoders in the highest resolution we want to offer to users (typically 1080p, 3,5 MBit/s).\nTo access the encoders a VPN connection to Studio 6 is necessary (host 217.199.77.138). Use the remote desktop app with the following adresses:\n   System IP     primary Encoder 192.168.14.66   secondary Encoder 192.168.14.14    Encoding profiles for production and test usage are available on both systems.\n2) Upstream to a Wowza Streaming Engine system This stream is ingested via RTMP connection to an AWS instance running Wowza Streaming Engine. This service handles transcoding of the original stream to multiple qualities and offers these as HLS stream.\nWe use two aws instances for fallback purposes. Typically we run both systems in parallel, so the CDN has two origin sources and can handle failover. We additionally use dch subdomains for both Wowza instances, this is needed for ssl support as stream origin sources for our CDN.\n   System IP Domain     primary Wowza http://54.93.166.183:8088 wowza-primary.digitalconcerthall.com   secondary Wowza http://52.57.34.227:8088 wowza-secondary.digitalconcerthall.com    If the ingest stream is coming from an external source, like another concert hall studio or from a mobile broadcast unit, please make sure that the upstream matches the typical DCH criteria in all audio and video settings and test on as many devices as possible before the production date.\n3) Deliver the HLS stream via CDN To provide best access to the DCH live stream we use the Edgecast CDN service to distribute it as adaptive bitrate stream in HLS format.\nThings to remember How to calculate bitrates for the HLS manifest Wowza offers the final HLS stream manifest in this format:\n#EXTM3U #EXT-X-VERSION:3 #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=3942400,CODECS=\u0026quot;avc1.77.40\u0026quot;,RESOLUTION=1920x1080 chunklist_b3584000.m3u8 #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2816000,CODECS=\u0026quot;avc1.77.41\u0026quot;,RESOLUTION=1280x720 chunklist_b2351104.m3u8  It is important to keep the \u0026ldquo;BANDWIDTH\u0026rdquo; value intact because some DCH clients use this value to pick particular stream qualities to show. Wowza calculates these values based on the target bitrate:\nBANDWITH = ((target bitrate x 1,10) + audio bitrate) * 1,10  How to set the live stream url for DCH DCH uses different stream names for each broadcast and offers the stream url data in multiple formats. Configuration settings are managed in a control panel of the DCH admin interface: https://admin.digitalconcerthall.com/streamconfig/live\nHow to test the live stream You can use the direct stream url (like http://livestream.digitalconcerthall.com/dch/ngrp:SiadAzb_web/playlist.m3u8 ) in many video players like VLC or Quickime Player or directly in Safari on desktop or mobile systems.\nDCH website Open a live concert detail page and call \u0026ldquo;DCH.Stage.Controller.openLiveConcertHall()\u0026rdquo; in the browser console.\nDCH-TV app Open the app as a user with test privelidges and you can start the live stream from any live concert tile.\ntvOS app Open the app as a user with test privelidges and go to the account screen - there you can enable live stream testing from the debug settings.\nAndroid mobile app Open the app as a user with test privelidges and go to the settings screen - there you can enable live stream testing.\n"

Every API 1.2 call that needs an API 1.2 device token will work right out of the box with the ID of an API 2.0 access token instead.\nThe API 2.0 access token’s ID can be retrieved through the payload of that token (see https://jwt.io/).

	"content": " 8-Point Grid System DCH Design System uses the 8-point Grid System to make sure spacing within and between elements stays consistent throughout the layout. It also reduces guesswork when it comes to interpreting reference files, and allows both designers to remove guesswork when creating new elements, as well as developers to make educated guesses if they are in any doubt about implementation.\nThe 8-point system should also be applied to margins, typography and basically any element with a unit measurement. But also remember that exceptions can prove a rule - Only deviate from the 8px grid system when the user experience is greatly improved by it.\nSpacing Philosophy While spacing is clearly defined in the specs for each element, from Atoms all the way up to Components, it\u0026rsquo;s good to have the general philosophy in action in mind. Since DCH includes a lot of visual content, ranging from images to video, it\u0026rsquo;s important to allow content to breathe with ample whitespace between elements, especially vertically. When applying margins to components, keep it on the generous side - but best is to look at already established components for inspiration.\n"

	"content": " 3.5.1 Tracking Stream Minutes If a client plays back video content (except for trailers and previews) it has to report every minute watched, regardless if it is paid or free content. This mechanism is crucial as it is used for calculating license fees. This also applies to audio only streams if an application implements this feature. In JSONAPI 1.2 this is done via the streamlog call. The logging system is separated from the core system and therefore it has to manage device information for itself. It also needs less device information.\n| Parameter | Optional | Purpose | | \u0026ndash; | \u0026ndash; | \u0026ndash; | | device_vendor | no | actual manufacturer of that device | | app_id | no | DCH internal ID of the app for that platform | | ts | no | UNIX timestamp of the client | | pos | no | current play position of the video/audio in seconds - for vod concerts this means the position in the currently played work, for live concerts this must always be the negative value -1. The value of pos must never be bigger than the duration of the content, this has to be validated on client side | | dur | no | current watched duration of the video/audio in seconds | | uid | no | user ID | | productid | no | ID of the current work, film or live concert - films and live concerts MUST NOT report any work ID but it\u0026rsquo;s own ID (without -X) | | hash | no | MD5 hash of the concatenation of API_KEY + UID + TS\nExample: md5(\u0026quot;APIKEY2351399966666\u0026quot;) when timestamp is 1399966666, user ID is 235 and the API key is APIKEY | | offline | yes | must be 1 when reporting minutes watched offline | | audio | yes | must be 1 when reporting minutes of audio only streams |\nAPI keys are available for every combination of a platform and DCH environment (DEV, TEST, LIVE) and must be requested at SkyGate.\nThe first call SHOULD be made after the first minute watched/listened. The subsequent call SHOULD be made when the current watched/listened duration hits exactly one minute more than before. Pausing a video or audio stream MUST assure that the duration will not be increased before the playback is started again. Skipping and trickplay MUST also assure that the duration will not change. They will only change the position. If a new video or audio stream is played back, the duration MUST be resetted first. This also applies if the new stream is the same as before. This could be the case when a user stops the playback (closes the player) and then decides to watch it/listen to it again.\nIn brief: 1. Duration changes only in play mode 2. Call will only be made after every 60 seconds added to the duration\nWhen reporting offline watched/listened content, a client MUST send every minute as a separate call after it gained access to the internet again.\nEndpoints | DCH Environment | URL | | \u0026ndash; | \u0026ndash; | | DEV | https://sl-dev.digitalconcerthall.com/streamlog.php | | TEST | http://api-test.dchdev.net/streamlog.php | | LIVE | https://api.digitalconcerthall.com/streamlog.php |\nTODO: Is SSL really mandatory? TEST URL is not SSL in this example Die Nutzung von SSL für die Aufrufe ist verpflichtend. Meldet der Streamlog-Server einen HTTP-Code 500 zurück, deutet dies auf fehlende oder falsche Parameter hin.

	"content": " How It Works When designing Digital Concert Hall, it\u0026rsquo;s important that any decision takes into consideration that we support many platforms, and for each, an exponential number of devices, with screens of many sizes.\nEach platform has its own way to define how to deal with different device sizes:\n Web uses media queries, with a wide choice of units (px/em/%/\u0026hellip;) iOS \u0026amp; tvOS uses size classes, and point Android uses screen density and density-independent pixels \u0026hellip;  As disparate as all these methods and measurements may be, most responsive sizing issues are global. In this manual, we have decided to utilize our own scale of breakpoints, which will then be translated to each platform.\nThroughout this document, these breakpoints will be referenced, and should be understood as the general guidelines for each platform\u0026rsquo;s respective responsive methods.\nUnits Our system uses a simple naming convention (XS, S, M, L and XL) and are defined in pixels. As we design everything in 1x, these pixels are equivalent to 1 point/dp.\n    Name Min. Width Max.

	"content": " Usage Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include Watch Concert, Preview, Share. Do not use Buttons as navigational elements.\nVariants Types of Button Icon Only Use this option only for commonly identifiably icons (favorite star, play/pause, etc), and only where the layout requires a small button.\nText Only Most calls to action can be solved with only text, as language is less dubious than iconography. Use clear, short and concise language, always from the user\u0026rsquo;s standpoint, and not our own (i.e. why would I click this?)\nIcon and Text This type of button is useful to reinforce an important call to action. For example, the \u0026ldquo;Watch Concert\u0026rdquo; button with a \u0026ldquo;play\u0026rdquo; icon helps catch the user\u0026rsquo;s attention to the function they are probably looking for. Avoid adding icons to buttons just for the sake of it, as text is often clearer than icons.\nHierarchy Primary Every page should have only one primary button. This should be the main action we expect the user to be looking for (as well as the one we would like them to choose). Avoid more than one primary action within the same viewport.\nSecondary Secondary actions are what most buttons will be on a page. They should not be split 50\u0026frasl;50 with a primary action, but they can be split with other secondary actions.\nStates Different platforms may require different button states. Please use the spec link as your reference for those.\n Button states Visual Reference  Buttons may be:  Dynamic width Defined by the size of the label Fixed button padding (defined in each breakpoint) Fixed width Width is specified as a number of grid columns, like full-width (100%) or half-width (1\u0026frasl;2 columns, spaced by gutter) Padding is half the padding (defined in breakpoint) Label width should not exceed space within padding If that happens, use ellipsis (…) and report to the content team for editing   XS \n One button per row; do not fit two buttons side-by-side The \u0026ldquo;half-width\u0026rdquo; buttons simply become full-width  S \n Two buttons may be used side-by-side (half-width), spaced by the gutter  M \n Component/Page define number of columns for full width/side-by-side buttons Number of columns must be even Half-width buttons are as wide as 1\u0026frasl;2 of available columns, spaced by the gutter   Accessibility alternative text status    "

	"content": " Digital Concert Hall The Berliner Philharmoniker’s Digital Concert Hall (DCH) is a ticket- or subscription-based video streaming service for classical music concerts, films and interviews, available on many platforms and devices. It is operated by the Berlin Phil Media GmbH, a wholly owned start-up subsidiary of the Berliner Philharmoniker Foundation, financed through its own revenues.\nThe orchestra plays about 50 concert programmes per season with usually three consecutive performances each. Only the last performance is streamed live to a paying public while the prior live performances are used for technical testing and studio rehearsals.\nWith few exceptions, the Digital Concert Hall features only concerts performed by the Berliner Philharmoniker. The broad repertoire of pieces and the wide roster of world class conductors and soloists ensure that the service provides enough variation.\nThe Digital Concert Hall is used by customers all around the world and is offered in multiple languages.\nGoals Users Keep paying customers satisfied Paying users must be reminded and inspired to keep using the service.\nCatch new users Any Digital Concert Hall application functions as a primary point of contact for a potential new user. It must explain in short and clear terms what the value of the Digital Concert Hall is and offer an incentive for the user to register for the service.\nConvert users to paying customers The application must clearly communicate in a friendly manner what content and which functions are reserved for paying customers and nudge the user towards becoming a paying customer.\nContent The Digital Concert Hall shall not only feature its own ever growing library of concert video productions from the year of its inception in 2008 but also as many historic concert recordings as possible.\nBesides concert related video content such as concerts and their related interviews, films in the form of documentaries or artist portraits provide a substantial additional benefit to familiarize customers with classical music in general and the Berliner Philharmoniker and their conductors in particular. Therefore the film archive should grow as well.\nIn 2016 streaming of lossless audio files was added to the DCH. Beginning with the recordings of Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings this section should be extended. It should ideally cover as much of the existing audio recordings with the orchestra as possible.\nTechnology The Digital Concert Hall should offer the best experience to explore, watch and listen to classical music recordings on any platform supported by the service. DCH clients should be the benchmark solution for this purpose on each platform. Therefore clients should adapt as platform specific best practice solutions while maintaining the core feature set and workflows of the DCH.\nWe want to reach this goal while balancing costs and benefits of our efforts.\nPrefer simple solutions over complex ones. This equally accounts for data structures, code, interfaces and workflows. If a feature or workflow can be made possible with a simpler solution, refactoring always is an option.\nPrefer solutions that are stable and efficient in the long term. Prefer open source technologies. Experiment with new technologies We welcome experiments and tests of new technologies as well as joint projects with other companies or institutions in the areas of hardware and software. The primary goal should be to improve the core product or make better user experiences possible in the future.\n"

	"content": " The navigation component is how users know where they are in the service, and the way for them to jump between major content sections, as well as settings and other views.\nEach major platform (iOS, tvOS, Android, etc) provides their own navigation system and best practices. Digital Concert Hall tries to follow those practices in order to provide a seamless experience which is familiar to users.\nThat means our navigation varies a lot depending on the system, and some elements may be less visible on certain platforms than others. The contents of the navigation, however, are defined globally.\nBreakdown Navigation Types Each platform uses a combination of different navigation types, and their contents vary as well.

	"content": " Below, will find a short overview of the Kibana web page. The official Kibana documentation provides a more detailed description of all functionality: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/index.html\nConnect The Kibana instance is available at http://172.30.1.206:8080.\nYou will need VPN access to load the website.\n\u0026ldquo;Discover\u0026rdquo; Panel This is the first panel that gets loaded. Its purpose is to be able to explore the data quickly. The log entries can be searched, filtered and ordered.\nYou can specify a time frame from which logs are visible in the top right corner.\nAn index pattern can be selected on the top left, directly below the search bar (see 7.2 Current Setup -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Index Patterns\u0026rdquo; section for information on how index patterns work).\nThe fields that are visible for each entry in the log list can be toggled by clicking on \u0026ldquo;add\u0026rdquo; in the field list on the left.\nAfter opening the detailed view of one of the log entries, a filter can be applied by clicking on the + or - buttons next to one of the field names. By clicking on the + button, only the specific log entries are shown that have the same value in their field. The - button creates a negative filter, so all log entries with the same value are hidden. For a list of all field names and their meaning, see 7.3 List of log fields.\nDetailed instructions on how to use this panel can be found here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/discover.html\n\u0026ldquo;Visualize\u0026rdquo; Panel On this panel, the data can be visualized in a variety of ways.\nYou can open an existing visualization on the right, or create a new one on the left. When creating a new visualization, you have to specify for which index pattern you want to create the visualization, i.e. for what set of data (see 7.2 Current Setup -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Index Patterns\u0026rdquo; section for information on how index patterns work). A newly created visualization can be saved by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; on the top bar.\nNote that visualizations are stored on the remote system, so all visualizations are visible and accessible to other users.\nDetailed instructions on how to use this panel can be found here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/visualize.html\n\u0026ldquo;Dashboard\u0026rdquo; Panel On this panel, multiple saved visualizations (created on the \u0026ldquo;Visualize\u0026rdquo; panel) can be put together on one screen to give an overview on certain metrics, graphs etc.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; on the top bar to add a visualization to a dashboard. To save the finished dashboard, click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.\nNote that dashboards are stored on the remote system, so all dashboards are visible and accessible to other users.\nDetailed instructions on how to use this panel can be found here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.2/dashboard.html\n"
