      <description>The navigation component is how users know where they are in the service, and the way for them to jump between major content sections, as well as settings and other views.
Each major platform (iOS, tvOS, Android, etc) provides their own navigation system and best practices. Digital Concert Hall tries to follow those practices in order to provide a seamless experience which is familiar to users.
That means our navigation varies a lot depending on the system, and some elements may be less visible on certain platforms than others.</description>
